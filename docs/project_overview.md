# Project Neptune: AI-Powered Flood Surveillance & Rescue Alert System

## Overview
Project Neptune is an advanced IoT-based flood surveillance and rescue alert system designed to monitor water levels, detect flooding events, and identify people in danger during flood situations. The system combines hardware sensors, AI-powered surveillance, and a real-time dashboard to provide comprehensive flood monitoring and emergency response capabilities.

## System Architecture

### 1. River Station Components
- ESP32 microcontroller for data collection and transmission
- Ultrasonic water level sensors
- Water flow sensors
- Temperature and humidity sensors
- Solar power system with battery backup
- LoRa/GSM communication modules

### 2. Main Station Server
- Python-based backend server
- Real-time data processing and storage
- Alert generation and notification system
- Web dashboard for visualization and monitoring

### 3. AI Surveillance System
- Flood detection algorithms using computer vision
- Person detection in flood waters
- Automated alert system for rescue operations
- Integration with emergency services

## Key Features
- Real-time water level monitoring
- Flood prediction based on historical and current data
- Person detection in flood situations
- Automated alerts and notifications
- Interactive web dashboard
- Energy-efficient design with solar power
- Remote monitoring and control capabilities

## Implementation Details
The system uses a distributed architecture with multiple river stations communicating with a central server. Each river station collects data about water levels, flow rates, and environmental conditions, which is then transmitted to the main server for processing and analysis.

The AI surveillance component analyzes camera feeds to detect flooding events and identify people who might be in danger. When a potential emergency is detected, the system generates alerts and notifications to relevant authorities and emergency services.

The web dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the entire system, displaying real-time data, alerts, and system status information in an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with weather forecasting services
- Mobile application for field workers
- Expanded sensor network for broader coverage
- Advanced machine learning models for improved prediction accuracy
- Drone integration for aerial surveillance and rescue operations
