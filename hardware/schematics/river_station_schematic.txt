/*
 * Power Management:
 * 
 * The river station uses a solar panel and rechargeable battery for off-grid operation.
 * 
 * Components:
 * - 10W Solar Panel
 * - Solar Charge Controller
 * - 12V 7Ah Lead Acid Battery or 3.7V 5000mAh LiPo Battery
 * - DC-DC Buck Converter (to convert battery voltage to 5V for Arduino)
 * 
 * For power optimization:
 * - Use sleep modes when not actively measuring or transmitting
 * - Reduce LoRa transmission frequency during normal conditions
 * - Increase sampling and transmission rates during alert conditions
 */

/*
 * Weatherproofing:
 * 
 * The river station should be housed in a weatherproof enclosure:
 * - IP65 or better rated enclosure
 * - Waterproof cable glands for sensor connections
 * - Mount solar panel at an angle for optimal sunlight and to prevent water pooling
 * - Position ultrasonic sensor facing downward toward water surface
 * - Use conformal coating on PCBs for additional moisture protection
 */

/*
 * Mounting:
 * 
 * The river station should be mounted:
 * - On a stable pole or structure above the maximum expected flood level
 * - With the ultrasonic sensor positioned directly above the water surface
 * - With the solar panel facing south (in northern hemisphere) or north (in southern hemisphere)
 * - With clear line of sight for LoRa transmission to the main station
